# Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder https://hyperskill.org/projects/58
## Stage 1
In this stage, you should write a program that creates errors in the input text, 1 random error per 3 symbols. An error means that the character is replaced by another random character. For example, “abc” characters can be “*bc” or “a*c” or “ab*”, where * is a random character. You can replace it with any character but it's recommended to use only uppercase and lowercase English letters, spacebar, and numbers.
